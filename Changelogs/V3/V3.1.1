//DEV NOTE//
After giving Odyssey 2 a performance update, I've decided to attempt and do the same by removing un-necessary mods that could impact the game negatively. While this isn't necessarily a performance update, it should help in performance.
Additions:
+ Lootr
+ Bountiful
+ Updated mods
Changes:
= Improved performance slightly.
= Fixed an error with the Multiblock Furnaces.
= Fixed Issue with Servers not being functioning.
Removals:
- GooglyEyes

- KleeSlabs
- Advanced Chimneys
- Large Ore Deposits and Advanced Finders
- Spartan Shields
- Aquaculture 2
- Corail Pillar (and Extensions)
- Emojiful
- MagmaMonsters
